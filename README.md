## CSS EXPLANATION - 
The CSS part defines the styling for various elements on the page.

body: The CSS for the entire page sets the display to flex to center its content vertically and horizontally. It also specifies a background color.

.light-bulb: The CSS for the light bulb container sets its position, width, and height.

.bulb: The CSS for the bulb itself sets its width, height, background color, and border radius. It also defines a transition for the background color.

.glow: The CSS for the glowing effect inside the bulb sets its position, width, height, and background. It also defines a radial gradient background and a pulsating animation.

.light: The CSS for the light filament sets its position, width, height, and background color. It defines a transition for opacity and an animation to make it spin.

.light-bulb:hover .bulb: This CSS rule changes the background color of the bulb when you hover over it.

.light-bulb:hover .light: This CSS rule applies a rotation animation to the light filament when you hover over it.

This code creates a simple and visually appealing interactive light bulb graphic using HTML and CSS.
